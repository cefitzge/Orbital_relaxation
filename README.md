# Orbital_relaxation
Based off work by: PHYSICAL REVIEW B 89, 075302 (2014), DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.89.075302 

Using same parameters in the above paper, I reproduced the phonon-induced relaxation plot (Fig 3). Using orbital_relaxation.cpp, I produced the data in the relaxation.txt file and plotted that with the Mathematica file orbital_relaxation.nb
